Recommender System

Current Feature Set and How to Use:
- In it's current form, the recommender parses PACE to find the queue with the fewest waiting jobs, and recommends that queue to submit to
- This recommendation will be subject to a few constraints:
  - If the time requested is greater than the Maximum Wall Time for the recommended queue, it will not recommend that queue
  - If the resources requested are more than the Maximum Allowed resources by the queue, it will not recommend that queue
  
- To use, run the recommender.py script before submitting a job. It will print out the recommended queue.
  `python recommender.py`
- Currently, the user will have to now submit their job as normal, manually defining the other hardcoded variables and the queue as the recommended queue

Future Features to Implement:
- Allow the recommender system to submit the job as well
- Take into account other variables such as walltime, processors, nodes, etc for different jobs
  - Basic analytics of jobs to predict these variables
- Regression algorithm for self-improvement of the recommender
- Expand the recommendation from queues to queues, processors, nodes, walltime, etc
- Analyze the status of PACE on job submission to get a current and accurate recommendation
  - Log the statuses of PACE over time to determine external factors affecting how fast the system can get a job running on PACE
  - Helps to determine best date/time of day to submit certain types of jobs
